This project aims to develop nuclei templates for evaluating OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) on websites and will involve creating templates that can be used to evaluate ASVS on websites, documenting the use of the templates, and designing and implementing a user interface for easy navigation and use of the templates. The templates and user interface will be tested for accuracy and usability, and once finalized, they will be made available for use. User feedback and usage of the templates and user interface will be monitored and analyzed, and updates will be made to the templates and user interface based on this feedback and usage. Finally, the project will be documented for future reference.

It's important to note that Since the implementation methods and frameworks used in web application design are very diverse, in this project, we will consider the existing best practice designs and develop nuclei templates based on them.
