# OWASP ASVS Security Evaluation Templates with Nuclei


This project aims to develop  [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) templates for evaluating OWASP Application Security Verification Standard ([ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)) on websites and will involve creating templates that can be used to evaluate ASVS on websites, documenting the use of the templates, and designing and implementing a user interface for easy navigation and use of the templates. 
 
 The goal is to provide security professionals with an easy-to-use set of tools to test their web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.
#### It's important to note that:
- Since the implementation methods and frameworks used in web application design are very diverse, in this project we will consider the existing best practice designs and develop nuclei templates based on them :)
- Also while these Nuclei templates are designed to help automate the process of evaluating web applications against ASVS requirements, they should not be considered a substitute for manual testing or other security best practices.
- Some templates are developed for a limited or specific scenario and should be modified and perfected according to the needs of the evaluator/user.
